  bio: |
    I am an AI scientist, sovereign AI consultant, and entrepreneur. Currently, I am in my entrepreneurial mode as the founder of Skillzo, a GenAI driven AI companion platform. Previously, I was heading the Applied AI division for BharatGen, a Government of India-backed Generative AI initiative.

    I have been fortunate to contribute to some of the recent progresses in AI while at Academia. These include my tenure at the University of Cambridge, UK and IT University of Copenhagen, as a postdoctoral researcher, and at IIT Kharagpur, India for my masters and PhD at the Computer Science (CSE) Department. At Cambridge, I was working with Dr Andreas Vlachos and Dr Sebastian Riedel on a project funded by Facebook research (now Meta). My PhD, supervised by Dr Pawan Goyal, was in Natural Language Processing, focusing specifically on Computational Sanskrit. 

    I am quite passionate about anything that involves human-AI interaction, with an accomplished track record in the areas of Spoken and Natural Language Processing, Understanding and Generation. Specifically, my areas of expertise include Large Language Models (LLMs), Conversational systems, Spoken language understanding (SLU), information extraction, program synthesis, structured prediction, morphology, and syntax. 

    I have a robust publication record, with over 30 papers garnering more than 400 citations, presented at esteemed venues including multiple CORE A/A* conferences. In addition to my research contributions, I actively contribute to the academic community. I currently serve as an action editor for the ACL rolling review (ARR) and have been a program committee member for prominent conferences such as ACL, EMNLP, among others, for the past 5 years. My commitment extends to reviewing for Computational Linguistics and LRE journals, and as an organiser for CODS-COMAD 2018, 2019 editions and for IndoML 2022 and 2023 editions. Complementing my research and academic engagements, I share my knowledge with a wide audience through a co-founded YouTube Channel dedicated to AI education, boasting over 100K+ subscribers.

  bio: |
    Welcome to my profile! As a lifelong learner, I have always been driven by my insatiable curiosity 
    and passion for exploring new fields and ideas. From a young age, I have been a natural problem-solver, 
    and this has led me to specialize in solving complex challenges related to mathematics and its various applications, 
    particularly in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP).

    Currently, my research interests lie in the field of Sanskrit Computational Linguistics, where I am exploring 
    the intersection between NLP and the Sanskrit language. My research is being done under the guidance of Dr. Pawan Goyal, 
    and it involves developing new techniques for processing Sanskrit text using NLP models and algorithms. 
    By leveraging the latest advancements in NLP and machine learning, I aim to make Sanskrit more accessible 
    to a wider audience, and help preserve this ancient language for future generations.

    In addition to my research interests, I have over 5 years of experience in Rakuten and Deloitte, 
    where I have worked on various use cases ranging from catalog enrichment using machine learning to intelligent crawlers, 
    marketing campaign optimization using machine learning, and scalable graph-based identity resolution. 
    These diverse experiences have given me a unique perspective on problem-solving and have allowed me 
    to connect various domains to bring value to businesses.

    In my work, I follow a rigorous problem-solving cycle, where I work collaboratively with stakeholders 
    to understand the problem, formulate hypotheses, brainstorm solutions, develop Proof of Concepts (PoCs), test, and deploy. 
    This iterative approach has been particularly useful in my work on NLP, where I specialize in solving problems 
    related to Causal Inference, Optimization, and other related areas.

    Apart from my research and industry experience, I am also a music lover, with a particular interest 
    in Indian Classical music, specifically Carnatic Music. I have a basic understanding of Carnatic Music 
    and enjoy playing ragas on musical instruments such as the Keyboard. Some of my favorite ragas include 
    Revati, Gaurimanohari, and Rusyaketupriya. If you share an interest in music or have any questions about my research, 
    industry experience, or Sanskrit Computational Linguistics, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.

    Thank you for taking the time to visit my profile, and I look forward to connecting with you 
    and exploring exciting opportunities together!
