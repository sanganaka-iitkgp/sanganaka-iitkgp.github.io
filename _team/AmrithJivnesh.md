I am an AI scientist, sovereign AI consultant, and entrepreneur. Currently, I am in my entrepreneurial mode as the founder of Skillzo, a GenAI driven AI companion platform. Previously, I was heading the Applied AI division for BharatGen, a Government of India-backed Generative AI initiative.

I have been fortunate to contribute to some of the recent progresses in AI while at Academia. These include my tenure at the University of Cambridge, UK and IT University of Copenhagen, as a postdoctoral researcher, and at IIT Kharagpur, India for my masters and PhD at the Computer Science (CSE) Department. At Cambridge, I was working with Dr Andreas Vlachos and Dr Sebastian Riedel on a project funded by Facebook research (now meta). My PhD, supervised Dr Pawan Gooyal, was in Natural Language Processing, focusing specifically on Computational Sanskrit. 

I am quite passionate about anything that involves human-AI interaction, with an accomplished track record in the areas of Spoken and Natural Language Processing, Understanding and Generation. Specifically, my areas of expertise include Large Language Models (LLMs), Conversational systems, Spoken language understanding (SLU), information extraction, program synthesis, structured prediction, morphology, and syntax. 

I have a robust publication record, with over 30 papers garnering more than 400 citations, presented at esteemed venues including multiple CORE A/A* conferences. In addition to my research contributions, I actively contribute to the academic community. I currently serve as an action editor for the ACL rolling review (ARR) and have been a program committee member for prominent conferences such as ACL, EMNLP, among others, for the past 5 years. My commitment extends to reviewing for Computational Linguistics and LRE journals, and as an organiser for CODS-COMAD 2018, 2019 editions and for IndoML 2022 and 2023 editions. Complementing my research and academic engagements, I share my knowledge with a wide audience through a co-founded YouTube Channel dedicated to AI education, boasting over 100K+ subscribers.
