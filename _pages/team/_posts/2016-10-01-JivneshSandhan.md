Dr. Jivnesh Sandhan is a postdoctoral researcher at the Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University. Prior to this, he served as a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the IIT Dharwad. He earned his Ph.D. from the Department of Electrical Engineering at IIT Kanpur in 2023, following a dual degree (B.Techâ€“M.Tech) in Mathematics and Scientific Computing from the same institution in 2018. He is a recipient of the prestigious Prime Minister's Research Fellowship (PMRF). His current research focus is on understanding and modeling the behavioral consistency of Large Language Models (LLMs) through the lens of Computational Psychometrics. His broader research interests include LLM Jailbreaking and Interpretability, Small Language Models, Animal Language Modeling and Sanskrit Computational Linguistics. He is particularly interested in how LLMs can be evaluated, aligned, and trusted in real-world, context-sensitive settings.
