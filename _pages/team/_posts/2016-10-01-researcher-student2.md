I am currently pursuing my Master’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Kharagpur, where I specialize in Sanskrit computational linguistics and natural language processing. My research focuses on developing advanced language models, self-supervised learning techniques, and low-resource machine translation methods tailored for morphologically rich languages.

I have contributed to several research projects and publications, including the creation of Vedavani, a benchmark corpus for automatic speech recognition on Vedic Sanskrit poetry, as well as innovations in dependency parsing and multilingual neural machine translation.
