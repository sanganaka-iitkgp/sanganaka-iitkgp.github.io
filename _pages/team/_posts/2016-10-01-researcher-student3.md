I am currently pursuing an MS (by Research) in Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. My academic focus includes cutting-edge areas such as Reinforcement Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Vision-and-Language Multimodal Learning.

Prior to this, I completed my Bachelor of Technology (BTech) in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Gauhati University, Guwahati, where I gained a strong foundation in technical principles and engineering practices.
