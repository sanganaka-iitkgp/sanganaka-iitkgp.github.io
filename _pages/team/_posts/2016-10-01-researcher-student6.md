I am a Artificial Intelligence researcher fueled by a lifelong passion for data and
complex equations. My fascination with Machine Learning (ML) began early, leading
me to bridge analytical instincts with real-world applications. Going through a wide
variety of experiences, I gained a versatile AI skillset which led me to the join the
Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur as a Project Engineer

I thrive on innovation and uncovering new ideas to solve problems creatively.  Iâ€™m now
focused on studying ML algorithms through their mathematical roots and original
papers. My research interests include Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Natural
Language Processing, and Model Optimization. Driven to push ML boundaries, I am
excited to explore theoretical foundations and apply my analytical skills in a research
setting.
