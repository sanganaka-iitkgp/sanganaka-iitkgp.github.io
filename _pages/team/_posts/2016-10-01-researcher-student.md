Welcome to my profile! As a lifelong learner, I have always been driven by my insatiable curiosity and passion for exploring new fields and ideas. From a young age, I have been a natural problem-solver, and this has led me to specialize in solving complex challenges related to mathematics and its various applications, particularly in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Currently, my research interests lie in the field of Sanskrit Computational Linguistics, where I am exploring the intersection between NLP and the Sanskrit language. My research is being done under the guidance of Dr. Pawan Goyal, and it involves developing new techniques for processing Sanskrit text using NLP models and algorithms. By leveraging the latest advancements in NLP and machine learning, I aim to make Sanskrit more accessible to a wider audience, and help preserve this ancient language for future generations.

In addition to my research interests, I have over 5 years of experience in Rakuten and Deloitte, where I have worked on various use cases ranging from catalog enrichment using machine learning to intelligent crawlers, marketing campaign optimization using machine learning, and scalable graph-based identity resolution. These diverse experiences have given me a unique perspective on problem-solving and have allowed me to connect various domains to bring value to businesses.

In my work, I follow a rigorous problem-solving cycle, where I work collaboratively with stakeholders to understand the problem, formulate hypotheses, brainstorm solutions, develop Proof of Concepts (PoCs), test, and deploy. This iterative approach has been particularly useful in my work on NLP, where I specialize in solving problems related to Causal Inference, Optimization, and other related areas.

Apart from my research and industry experience, I am also a music lover, with a particular interest in Indian Classical music, specifically Carnatic Music. I have a basic understanding of Carnatic Music and enjoy playing ragas on musical instruments such as the Keyboard. Some of my favorite ragas include Revati, Gaurimanohari, and Rusyaketupriya. If you share an interest in music or have any questions about my research, industry experience, or Sanskrit Computational Linguistics, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.

Thank you for taking the time to visit my profile, and I look forward to connecting with you and exploring exciting opportunities together!
