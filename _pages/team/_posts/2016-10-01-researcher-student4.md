I'm currently working as a Language Analyst (Researcher) at IIT Kharagpur under the BHASHINI-NLTM project funded by MeitY.

My research focuses on interpretable multilingual translation using Sanskrit-based interlingua representations. I hold a B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering (2021â€“2025) with a CGPA of 8.8/10.

I've qualified GATE CS '24, '25 and DA '25 and bring hands-on experience in Python, machine learning, NLP, and language modeling, backed by 15+ end-to-end projects.
