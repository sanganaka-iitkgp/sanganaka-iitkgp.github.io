# Research

The project proposes to use an interlingua framework rooted on the traditional grammatical system of Sanskrit. The project will focus on Hindi, Sanskrit and Kannada as a representative subset of the Indian languages such that any observations and research innovations catering to one or more of these languages wouldbenefit other languages. Towards this primary objective of text to text translation, the project will have the following sub-objectives:

Develop an explainable interlingua interpreter that can capture linguistic characteristics of the languages considered under the framework and facilitate translation among these languages
Develop a text-to-text (T2T) translation module for translation among text in different languages and the interlingua structure
Human benchmarking of explainability and linguistic correctness of interlingua as a post-hoc explainer.

## Use Cases

Linguistically faithful and interpretable translation system for the translation of text among multiple Indian languages.

## Projects

- **National Language Translation Mission (NLTM)**

  Language plays a vital role in shaping national identity, especially in a multilingual country like India, where digital information is spread across many languages. Enabling access to content in native languages is essential, creating the need for a framework to support seamless information sharing across languages.

  Under the Technology Development for Indian Languages (TDIL) Programme, efforts have been made to standardize Indian languages for digital use — through UNICODE adoption, web layout standards, and Inscript keyboard layouts. Toolkits for 22 Indian languages have enabled word processing, email, presentations, and web browsing in local scripts.

  Research in machine translation, optical character recognition, and speech technologies has further demonstrated the potential for scalable AI-based solutions.

  The National Language Translation Mission (NLTM) builds on these foundations to remove language barriers using technology, making governance and policy-related content available in major Indian languages.


- **Sanskrit Knowledge Accessor**

  The Sanskrit Knowledge Accessor project aims to bridge the gap between ancient Sanskrit texts and contemporary readers by developing advanced linguistic tools and resources. The project focuses on three key applications and several core objectives:

  ### Key Applications

  1. **Ayurveda Reading Aid for Vaidyas**  
     Develop a tool that assists Ayurvedic practitioners in reading and understanding Sanskrit texts, enhancing their ability to access traditional medical knowledge.

  2. **Darshana or Classics Reading Aid**  
     Create a reading aid to popularize classical Sanskrit literature, such as the Upanishads and Mahābhārata, among the general public. This tool will facilitate easier comprehension and appreciation of these timeless works.

  3. **Objective-type Question-Answering System on Bhāvaprakāśa Nighanṭu (BPN)**  
     Implement a system that allows users to ask objective-type questions about the Bhāvaprakāśa Nighanṭu, a classical Ayurvedic text, and receive precise answers, aiding in the study and understanding of this important work.

  ### Core Objectives

  1. **Development of Sanskrit-Hindi, Sanskrit-English, and Sanskrit-Tamil Accessors**  
     Build language access tools that support translation and comprehension between Sanskrit and Hindi, English, and Tamil. These accessors will facilitate reading and interpretation of Sanskrit texts across different linguistic backgrounds.

  2. **Generation of High-Quality Annotated Data**  
     Produce linguistically rich, annotated data sets semi-automatically. This data will be essential for training and improving language models and other linguistic tools, ensuring high accuracy and utility.

  3. **Exploration of Traditional Knowledge in Mīmāṃsā and Other Literature**  
     Investigate and leverage traditional theories of verbal cognition found in Mīmāṃsā and other Sanskrit literature to understand and structure discourse. This exploration will provide deeper insights into ancient Indian knowledge systems and enhance the effectiveness of the developed tools.
