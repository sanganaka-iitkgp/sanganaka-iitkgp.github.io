  The Sanskrit Computational Research Lab (Sanganaka) at IIT Kharagpur explores the intersection of classical linguistics, artificial intelligence, and Indian knowledge systems. Led by Prof. Pawan Goyal, the lab develops cutting-edge computational tools for Sanskrit, including word segmentation, morphological tagging, syntactic parsing, and machine translation. With projects like SanskritShala and DepNeCTI, the lab is transforming Sanskrit into a computationally empowered language of the future.
